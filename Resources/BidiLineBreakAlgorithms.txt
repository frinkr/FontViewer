1. Split the logical text by script and embedding level into BidiRuns
2. Shape each BidiRun by direction -> glyphs of RTL text are reversed
3. Reverse the glyphs of RTL BidiRun -> This created a list of glyphs in logical order
4. Line break as usual
5. For each line, reorder the glyphs according to the bidi types and levels
